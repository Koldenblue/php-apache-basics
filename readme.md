This code consists of basic php code.

These files are meant to be used with an Apache server. Apache server comes loaded with macOS. Files must be in the proper document root folder, which may be found in the Apache httpd.conf file. Apache server may be started by running "apachectl start" in a terminal.

The npm package php-express will allow use of php with an express server, but global / superglobal variables will not be configured.
